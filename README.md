# softuni-homes-exam

This is a project that I have built during the regular exam in SoftUni.

It contains a custom WordPress theme and a custom WordPress plugin for creating a homes borad website.

It has a plugin that takes care of creating the custom post type.

Steps to install:
- clone the project
- create a database locally
- upload the database
- create your local wp-config.php file
